## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to:
1. Analyze customer churn data to uncover patterns and insights.
2. Develop actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
3. Present findings and strategies in a clear, data-driven format.

## Data Sources

The data utilized for this analysis included:
1. **Customer Subscription Information**: Details of services signed up by customers (e.g., internet, streaming services, device protection).
2. **Demographic Information**: Gender, age range, partner and dependent status.
3. **Account Information**: Duration as a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly and total charges.
4. **Service Interaction Data**: Number of tickets opened for administrative and technical issues.

These inputs were provided by PhoneNow's Retention Manager, Janet, in the [reference document](PhoneNow%20referance%20mail.pdf).

## Analysis Process

The analysis was conducted using **Microsoft Power BI**, with the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Checked for missing or inconsistent data.
   - Ensured data accuracy for key metrics like monthly charges and churn status.

2. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize churn trends and customer behavior.
   - Created filters to segment data by contract type, payment method, and add-on services.

3. **Insight Extraction**:
   - Analyzed correlations between churn and variables such as contract type, payment method, and demographic characteristics.
   - Identified high-risk groups based on their likelihood of churning.

## Key Findings

1. **High Churn Rate**:
   - The overall churn rate is **27%**, with month-to-month contracts being the most significant contributor.

2. **Payment Method Impact**:
   - Customers using **electronic check** as their payment method have a higher churn rate compared to those using automated payments (bank transfer or credit card).

3. **Service and Add-On Analysis**:
   - Customers lacking add-ons such as **device protection** or subscribed to **fiber optic internet services** are more likely to churn.

4. **Demographic Trends**:
   - Senior citizens and customers without partners exhibit a higher churn tendency.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhance Contractual Offerings**:
   - Provide incentives for customers on month-to-month contracts to switch to longer-term subscriptions, such as discounts or added benefits.

2. **Refine Payment Options**:
   - Launch campaigns to encourage customers to switch from electronic checks to automated payment methods for better retention.

3. **Promote Add-On Services**:
   - Design bundles that include critical add-ons like device protection and offer them at discounted rates to improve satisfaction.
