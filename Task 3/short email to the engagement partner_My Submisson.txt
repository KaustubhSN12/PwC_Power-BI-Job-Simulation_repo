Subject: Key Findings and Recommendations from Customer Churn Analysis

Dear Janet Retention Manager,

After analyzing the data from the Customer Churn Insights Dashboard, here are the key findings:

High Churn Rate: The overall churn rate stands at 27%, with month-to-month contracts being a significant driver of this trend.
Payment Method Correlation: Customers using electronic check as their payment method exhibit a higher churn rate compared to other methods like bank transfer or credit card.
Service and Add-On Impact: Customers without add-ons such as device protection are more likely to churn, especially those subscribed to fiber optic internet services.
Demographic Trends: There is a notable churn tendency among customers without partners, particularly in the senior citizen demographic.

Recommendations for Improvement:

Enhance Contractual Offerings: Introduce incentives, such as discounts or added benefits, for customers on month-to-month contracts to promote longer-term subscriptions.
Refine Payment Options: Consider targeted campaigns to shift customers away from electronic checks to automated payment methods for greater retention.
Upsell Add-On Services: Promote bundles that include critical add-ons like device protection to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn.
Targeted Retention Strategies: Design personalized retention campaigns for high-risk groups, focusing on senior citizens and customers without partners.


Please let me know if youâ€™d like a detailed walkthrough of the dashboard or further refinements to support these strategies.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
